// // Simple Java program to find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or GCF  (Greatest Common Factor) 
// or HCF (Highest common factor). The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides
//  both the numbers fully i.e. without any remainder. There are multiple methods to find GCD, GDF, or 
//  HCF of two numbers but  Euclid's algorithm is very popular and easy to understand, of course, only
//   if you understand how recursion works. Euclid's algorithm is an efficient way to find the GCD of 
//   two numbers and it's pretty easy to implement using recursion in the Java program. According to 
//   Euclid's method GCD of two numbers, a, b is equal to GCD(b, a mod b) and GCD(a, 0) = a.
