Given two numbers X and Y, calculate their multiplication using the Karatsuba Algorithm.
// Input: X = “1234”, Y = “2345”
// Output: Multiplication of x and y is 28,93,730.

// Naive Method
// The naive method is to follow the elementary school multiplication method, i.e. to multiply 
// each digit of the second number with every digit of the first number and then add all the multiplication
//  results.
